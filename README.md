# Reverse Engineering & Exploitation Lab

**Author:** S3cr3tpt  
**Focus:** Binary Exploitation, Malware Analysis, Network Protocols, Red Teaming  
**Status:** Active Research

## 1. Overview
This repository documents my journey into low-level security research. It contains detailed analysis, custom solvers, and automated exploit scripts for various crackmes, CTF challenges, and real-world vulnerabilities.

My approach favors **"First Principles"**:
- **Manual Analysis:** Reading assembly (x86/x64) before running automated tools.
- **Custom Tooling:** Writing Python/C scripts instead of relying solely on pre-made exploits.
- **Documentation:** detailed engineering logs explaining *why* an exploit works.

## 2. Project Structure
- **/Crackmes**: Detailed write-ups and solvers for binary challenges.
  - `NetCrack-693017b5`: Network-based password validation bypass (Python/Bash).
- **/Malware-Analysis**: (Coming Soon) Deobfuscation and behavior analysis.
- **/Shellcode**: (Coming Soon) Custom shellcode development.

## 3. Disclaimer
This repository is for **educational and defensive purposes only**. All binaries analyzed here are legal challenges (Crackmes) or safe research environments.
