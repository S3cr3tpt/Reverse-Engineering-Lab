# Analysis: ToasterBirb Flags (Crackme)
Target: flags (ELF 64-bit)
Type: Bitwise Logic Check

## 1. Reverse Engineering
- The binary reads input and enters a `do-while` loop.
- Counter starts at 5 and decrements to 0.
- Check: `bVar4 & (Input_Byte << Counter)`
- Target Mask: `0x40` (Binary 0100 0000)

## 2. The Constraint
The loop fails if the bitwise AND operation returns 0.
We need to provide bytes that, when left-shifted by the counter value, align with the 0x40 bit.

Calculations:
- Counter 5: x << 5 = 64  -> x = 2  (0x02)
- Counter 4: x << 4 = 64  -> x = 4  (0x04)
- Counter 3: x << 3 = 64  -> x = 8  (0x08)
- Counter 2: x << 2 = 64  -> x = 16 (0x10)
- Counter 1: x << 1 = 64  -> x = 32 (0x20)

## 3. Exploit Strategy
Instead of sending a static string, I wrote a Python script to generate valid bytes dynamically. 
The script ensures the required bit is set (OR operation) while randomizing the others to prove the "don't care" bits do not affect the validity.
